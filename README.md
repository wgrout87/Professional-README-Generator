## Description

This is a command line application for generating a README.md file. It was written using JavaScript to run with Node.js. When run, the user is prompted to fill out information that will provide the content of their README file. The generated file is output into the dist folder that is within the same directory as the application.

## Installation

After downloading the code from the GitHub repository, "npm install" should be run in the command line while in the base directory of the application. This will download all of the necessary dependencies for the application to be used.

## Usage

The application can be run from the command line while in the base directory where index.js is located by typing the command "node index". The user will then be prompted with questions to fill out the desired README sections with options including installation, usage, licenses, methods of contributing, tests, and questions. Once the questions have been answered, a README.md file will be generated to include any sections the user chose.
